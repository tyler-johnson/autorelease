Automatically release NPM packages based on commit messages.

This is very similar to [semantic-release](http://ghub.io/semantic-release), but *it is much less opinionated*. By default, this library does not assume you are using any specific remote git repository host or continuous integration platform. There is full Travis and Gitlab CI support through external plugins.

> Note: This library is still under-development and does totally work yet.
